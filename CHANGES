Change Log
-----------

Version v0.2:

  - Implemented the 'apply_decorator' function on the Page class, which allows decorators to
    be applied to pages on demand.  Currently implemented only from the decorators themselves,
    but it might be advantageous to allow this on pages even though I can't see a use for it
    just yet.

  - Abstracted decorator location and execution logic into two new classes: DecoratorSelector
    and Decorator respectively.

  - Changed many method and variable names, bringing them more inline with SiteMesh's tag names
    where appropriate and making naming scheme more PHP-like.


Version 0.1:

  - Initial release.
