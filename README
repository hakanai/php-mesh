PURPOSE:

    There has been a wonderful project for a while, started by the OpenSymphony
    team, called SiteMesh.

    SiteMesh is a way to merge and style web pages, without needing complicated
    and hard to learn technologies such as XSL, and without needing unnecessary
    cruft such as header and footer includes.

    The goal of this project is to bring the convenience and simplicity of the
    SiteMesh approach to PHP, borrowing from the Java version where appropriate.

REQUIRMENTS:

    PHP 4.1.2 is known to work.  Earlier versions may work too but are untested.
        (I will add more to this list if you send me a report on what works
         and what doesn't.)

    An Apache web server environment is preferable, as it is the server which
    my sample configuration scripts are written for.  Other servers should work
    with the correct configuration (but does anyone really run anything else?)

INSTALLING:

    (Instructions will assume installation by an ordinary user, not for
     site-wide use.)

    1. Extract the PHP-Mesh archive to a known location, such as ~/phpmesh .

    2. Copy and customise the contents of the 'htaccess' file in the examples
       directory to the .htaccess file in the root of your document directory.
       For example, if you are an ordinary user, you should add it to
       ~/public_html/.htaccess .  If the file does not exist, you can create it.

    3. Copy and customise the 'phpmeshrc' file in the examples directory to
       the root of your document directory as .phpmeshrc .  Using the same
       example, this would be ~/public_html/.phpmeshrc .

    4. Create a 'decorators' directory in your document root and copy the file
       'default.php' from the examples directory into the new decorators
       directory.

    5. Complete!  Viewing a PHP file from your document directory should now
       result in the file being meshed with the example decorator.

TODO:

    There is much to do.  I am pretty close to the core functionality of the
    Java version of SiteMesh now, but I'm sure there are a whole lot of things
    left to complete before 1.0!

    The next version should have more documented examples.
