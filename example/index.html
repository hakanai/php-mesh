    <p> If you see a dotted red border around this page then PHP-Mesh is working as expected.</p>

    <p> Notice how no HTML or PHP code had to be added to the test page in order to add this border.</p>

    <!-- This trick makes the following paragraph display only if PHP is not enabled.
         If you see this text in an HTML comment, there is no problem with your setup. -->
    <?php print("<!--"); ?>
    <p> PHP is not enabled.  Your Apache configuration probably needs fixing.</p>
    <?php print("-->"); ?>
